## What is tidy data?


While neither *wide* or *long* data is more correct than the other, we will work with *long* data as it is clearer how many distinct types of variables there are in our data *and* the tools we will be using from the `tidyverse` are designed to work with *long* data.

## Using `pivot` functions

There are functions found as part of the `tidyverse` that can help us to reshape data. 

* `tidyr::pivot_wider()` - from *long* to *wide* format

* `tidyr::pivot_longer()` - from *wide* to *long* format


```{r img-pivot-gif, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Reshaping data with pivot"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyr_longer-wider.gif")

```


```{r, eval = T}
 country <- c("x", "y", "z")
 yr1960 <-  c(10, 20, 30)
 yr1970 <-  c(13, 23, 33)
 yr2010 <-  c(15, 25, 35)

country_data <- tibble(country, yr1960, yr1970, yr2010)
country_data
```



```{r pivot-data, eval = F}

pivot_longer(data = country_data,
             cols = yr1960:yr2010,
             names_to = "year",
             names_prefix = "yr",
             values_to = "metric")

```

```{r img-pivot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Reshaping data with pivot"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyr_pivot.png")

```


To *save* these changes to your data format, you must assign this to an object, and you have two options

* Use the same name as the original R object, this will *overwrite* the original with the new format

* Use a *new* name for the reformatted data both R objects will exist in your Environment

Neither is more *correct* than the other but be aware of what you are doing.


### Overwrite the original object 

```{r, eval = F}
country_data <- pivot_longer(data = country_data,
             cols = yr1960:yr2010,
             names_to = "year",
             names_prefix = "yr",
             values_to = "metric")

```

### Create a new r object

```{r, eval = F}

long_country_data <- pivot_longer(data = country_data,
             cols = yr1960:yr2010,
             names_to = "year",
             names_prefix = "yr",
             values_to = "metric")

```
