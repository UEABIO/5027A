alpha: |
  The threshold chosen in Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing to distinguish test results that lead to the decision to reject the null hypothesis, or not, based on the desired upper bound of the Type 1 error rate. An alpha level of 5% is most commonly used, but other alpha levels can be used as long as they are determined and preregistered by the researcher before the data is analyzed.
p-value: |
  The probability of the observed data, or more extreme data, if the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value, the higher the test statistic, and the less likely it is to observe the data if the null hypothesis is true.
console: |
  The R console is the interactive interface within the R environment where users can type and execute R code. It is the place where you can directly enter commands, see their output, and interact with the R programming language in real-time.
tidy data: |
  Tidy data refers to a specific format for organizing datasets that makes data easier to work with for analysis and visualization in R, especially using the tidyverse. The concept was popularized by Hadley Wickham in his paper "Tidy Data" and is an essential principle for effective data manipulation.
pipe: |
  An operator that allows you to chain multiple functions together in a sequence.
blank slate: |
  R projects are set not to store their .Rhistory file, which means everything required to recreate your analysis is contained in your scripts.
snake case: |
  Snake case is a naming convention in computing that uses underscores to replace spaces between words, and writes words in lowercase. It's commonly used for variable names, filenames, and database table and column names.
normal distribution: |
  Also known as the "Gaussian distribution," it is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.
correlation coefficient: |
  A numerical value ranging from -1 to 1 that measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
scatterplot: |
  A graph that displays the relationship between two numerical variables by plotting data points on an X and Y axis.
confounding variable: |
  A variable that affects both the independent and dependent variables, potentially distorting the observed relationship between them.
bias: |
  A systematic error or distortion in data collection or analysis that leads to inaccurate conclusions or results.
central tendency: |
  A statistical measure that identifies the center or typical value in a dataset, often represented by the mean, median, or mode.
variation: |
  A measure of how spread out or dispersed the data points are in relation to each other or the central value.
histogram: |
  A graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset by grouping data into bins and showing the frequency of observations within each bin.
boxplot: |
  A compact visual summary of a datasets distribution, showing the median, interquartile range (IQR), and outliers.
outliers: |
  Data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset, often lying far from the median or mean.
density plot: |
  A smoothed curve that represents the distribution of a dataset, showing the probability density of different values.
mean: |
  The average of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations.
standard deviation: |
  A measure of the amount of variation or spread in a dataset, indicating how far data points are from the mean on average.
