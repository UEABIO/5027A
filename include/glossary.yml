alpha: |
  The threshold chosen in Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing to distinguish test results that lead to the decision to reject the null hypothesis, or not, based on the desired upper bound of the Type 1 error rate. An alpha level of 5% it most commonly used, but other alpha levels can be used as long as they are determined and preregistered by the researcher before the data is analyzed.
p-value: |
  The probability of the observed data, or more extreme data, if the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value, the higher the test statistic, and less likely it is to observe the data if the null hypothesis is true.
console: |
  The R console is the interactive interface within the R environment where users can type and execute R code. It is the place where you can directly enter commands, see their output, and interact with the R programming language in real-time.
tidy data: |
  Tidy data refers to a specific format for organizing datasets that makes data easier to work with for analysis and visualization in R, especially using the tidyverse. The concept was popularized by Hadley Wickham in his paper "Tidy Data" and is an essential principle for effective data manipulation.
pipe: |
   An operator that allows you to chain multiple functions together in a sequence
blank slate: |
   R projects are set not to store their .Rhistory file which means everything required to recreate your analysis is contained in your scripts
snake case: |
  Snake case is a naming convention in computing that uses underscores to replace spaces between words, and writes words in lowercase. It's commonly used for variable and subroutine names, filenames, and database table and column names
normal distribution: |
  Also known as the "Gaussian distribution", it is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graphical form, the normal distribution appears as a "bell curve".
